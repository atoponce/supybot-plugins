Supybot plugin for http://thefuckingweather.com. You must have
'thefuckingweather' Python module installed:

    # easy_install thefuckingweather

You may also need some addional Python modules installed, such as
BeautifulSoup and urllib for that to succeed.

Of course, you need a Supybot. Once installed, query the bot, load the
plugin, and test:

    load FWeather
    fw 99705
